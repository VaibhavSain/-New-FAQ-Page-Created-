ðŸš€ Project Alert: New FAQ Page Created!

I'm excited to announce that I've just completed a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page using HTML and CSS!

Project Highlights:

    Clean & Responsive Design: Ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
    Easy Navigation: Structured layout with collapsible question sections.
    Custom Styling: Tailored fonts, colors, and spacing for a professional look.

Why This Matters:
A well-crafted FAQ page enhances user experience by addressing common questions, reducing customer support inquiries, and boosting SEO.

Next Steps:

    Integrating some JavaScript for interactive elements (like animations or toggles).
    Gathering feedback for further refinement.

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!
